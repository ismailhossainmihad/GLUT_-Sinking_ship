# 🚢 Sinking Ship – OpenGL Animation Project

A simple computer graphics mini-project that simulates a ship sailing and sinking upon collision with an obstacle. Built using **OpenGL** and **GLUT**, this project demonstrates basic 2D animation and keyboard interaction in C++.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project visualizes a ship moving across the sea. As the ship progresses, it encounters an obstacle (like an iceberg), leading to a collision that results in the ship sinking. The animation is controlled via keyboard inputs, providing an interactive experience.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: C++
* **Graphics Library**: OpenGL
* **Utility Toolkit**: GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **OpenGL** and **GLUT** libraries installed on your system.
* A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ismailhossainmihad/GLUT_-Sinking_ship.git
   cd GLUT_-Sinking_ship
   ```

2. **Compile the code:**

   ```bash
   g++ sinking_ship.cpp -o sinking_ship -lGL -lGLU -lglut
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   ./sinking_ship
   ```
